# F.lux coordinate finder

This is a simple python program for finding a coordinates for F.lux-program where sunset happens at desired local time.

F.lux doesn't allow setting sunset time manually, so if you live far from equator, F.lux may start dimming your screen too early or too late depending of season. With this program you can enter youd desired "sunset" time, as well as your timezone, and it will show you longitude coordinates you should enter to F.lux. Latitude is naturally 0.

### Usage example

```
python3 run.py +2 19:00
```
